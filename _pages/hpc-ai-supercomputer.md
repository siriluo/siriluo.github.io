# HPC in the Era of AI-centered Supercomputer

## Difference between HPC and AI-centered Cloud Supercomputer

High-Performance Computing (HPC) traditionally refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems in science, engineering, and industry. HPC systems are optimized for tasks such as large-scale simulations, modeling, and data analysis, often relying on tightly-coupled hardware and software to maximize performance for specific workloads.

AI-centered cloud supercomputers, on the other hand, are designed with artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads as a primary focus. These systems leverage cloud infrastructure to provide scalable, on-demand resources, and are optimized for training and deploying large AI models. They often feature specialized hardware such as GPUs, TPUs, or custom AI accelerators, and support distributed training across thousands of nodes. The flexibility and scalability of cloud-based AI supercomputers enable rapid experimentation and deployment of cutting-edge AI applications.

In summary, while traditional HPC focuses on scientific computing and simulation, AI-centered cloud supercomputers are tailored for the unique demands of modern AI workloads, offering flexibility, scalability, and specialized hardware to accelerate AI research and deployment.
