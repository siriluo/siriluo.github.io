Welcome to my homepage! I am a Research Scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Prior to joining Illinois, I earned my Ph.D. in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, where I was advised by Prof. Tengfei Luo.

My research focuses on high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on their applications in scientific research. I am particularly interested in advancing computational methods for healthcare, geoscience, and engineering simulation.

In 2023, I was honored to receive second place in the **DARPA AI Challenge** ([link](https://criticalminerals.darpa.mil/The-Competition)), and I was a **Golden Bell Finalist** Nominee at SC 2023 ([link](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/2023/08/a-look-at-the-2023-gordon-bell-prize-finalists/)).

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lTT-vAoAAAAJ&hl=en) for the list of publications.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or potential collaborations!
